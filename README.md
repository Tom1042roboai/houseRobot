# HouseRobot stage 1: Mini ROS 4wd Robotic Vehicle
In the first stage of the HouseRobot project, I aim to design and build a small ROS-based (Robot Operating System) vehicle capable of mapping and navigating around the house. Subsequent stages will build upon this foundation. Through this stage, I plan to gain further experience with the following technologies:
- ROS
- LiDAR
- SLAM
- Navigation
- Frontier Exploration
- Ubuntu for embedded devices
